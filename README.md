IOI - Image of Image

What am i doing?
-> Playing around with binary custom and fine tuning model (Effecient net) using pytorch on a dataset of around 3k images combined which is almost equally balanced to determine if an image is IOI or not .
-> I've first tried with tensorflow and later shifted to pytorch for more control.
